            I&apos;m a Software Engineer at Energy Toolbase, focused on building
            scalable and efficient software. Before that, I spent 16 months at
            Garmin working on embedded systems. I graduated in 2024 with a
            Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from the University of
            Calgary. My favorite coursework included Operating Systems, Software
            Design, Computer Networks, Distributed Systems, and Machine
            Learning. I&apos;m particularly interested in machine learning, backend
            development, and systems engineering.
